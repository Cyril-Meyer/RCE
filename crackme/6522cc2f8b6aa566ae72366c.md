**What makes it a special** :
* obfuscation which create exception when decompiling methods.
* debugger detection.
* order of the line of codes is obfuscated using loops and switch with a "next line" paramters equal to arithmetic operations.

## Walkthrough

When we open the binary with dnSpy, you will see that classes names has been obfuscated but also that exception with decompiler prevents us from seeing anything interesting.

|`An exception occurred when decompiling this method (06000004)`|

Before trying anything complicated, we can try to debug the process using the dnSpy integrated debugger.
The process crash due to a `Environment.FailFast(null);` call.

|`System.ExecutionEngineException`|

If we look more in details into the class, we can understand that this call is triggered because of the `internal static bool Detected()` method, which probably detect the debugging.
We will see this more in details in the `Detected()` section, bottom of page.
For now, lets focus on the **key**.

Even if the process crash, dnSpy allow us to analysis it.
So, now we can view the code withtout the previous decompiling exception.

There is 4 renamed by obfuscation :
* `private static void <ECPpdSdBteSsGbtNLqLwpCofjRjOYDjWZgsvJrPfhjyCwJdkTszHJPMboKfmIoDQVVtAIYeuAFpfeMIzOZVGeBmjurhYlDwSGIGAqDCUofgdAGWBcGxJsXLuJkfrRfi>()`
* `private void <MLAckGFFeaxppyOZZwLCQvaoLqSxAaTGvWqQcunLanJrFZJHTxMVPozrLlqTNifdgQTsiYXEjaCDLIJLHlEcoXRgwZeQetXShGkPgqyUAhMOMWFcCEmCEdPiZMVjTgAPcKvfxUErMJCglcuAtcozhvneQcPuupatHXMcAAEIZVPVAJXW>()`
* `private void <svPRSbIHwrovekWxIiznpraTxGzlFsDheTcZzjBFpfGiljDPZsmsjJGauWtlBwbeOgqliXYzGTYkLRHocKmnfkXumb>(object sender, EventArgs e)`
* `public static void <swbMlBElspAKrtSZRQOZGTwGAYmVrgmAMcNspMjsXIhoelaOtgyNmalyZvlmpITmdZXpGzJfGvcXLiBpYyBlIyoMRosUAXdoOVlfnLiTwtgQYnNRTWoQhIEELkxrhPEJsNiQXwbmqHOosxODBBaEImhgrGtcnQMHPxxkeWTwUbAzUplnwUPGOZagGczqdZYzVgzVaEyFHEKHLImbugGtbfSPwrEcxCtVcbDNQqnSvkYkptuYPxVWsFxPoJyJZvhflPEKezleTOXRhIAdWGnaGwCxDOzgS>()`

Looking at the code and specialy the called method, we can "rename" them in our mind by what they do.
As we already work on a crackme from the same author ([64fb27f4d931496abf909849](64fb27f4d931496abf909849.md)) we can imagine that the architeture  is similar.
* `private static void Main()`
* `private void InitializeComponent()`
* `private void checkButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)`
* `public static void crashIfDetection()`

Using the `Analyze` functionality of dnSpy, we can create a simplified view of the call order.

```
Main()
  -> crashIfDetection()
  -> Run()
    -> InitializeComponent()
      -> checkButton_Click() // event
```

Looking at the `checkButton_Click` we can understand that this method is responsible for password check and result show.

```
// [...]

if (this.<hdAiqkfFbfnVzgKWSaIpOsFElupffVrrWHqfTWeiEAfIZQUrjOzNMpQOyVWVUZAfNWYRQFdWVALnmXFuzYWrw>.Text == "&#x46;&#x52;&#x45;&#x45;&#x4d;&#x41;&#x53;&#x4f;&#x4e;&#x52;&#x59;")
{
  goto IL_17;
}

// [...]

  case 4U:
    MessageBox.Show("Correct Passcode");
    num2 = (num * 890222902U ^ 1348551447U);
    continue;

// [...]
```

We can check the `&#x46;&#x52;&#x45;&#x45;&#x4d;&#x41;&#x53;&#x4f;&#x4e;&#x52;&#x59;` string and view that this is the valid solution for the crackme.

**Author's note :** If we look at the ascii character corresponding to the hex digits, the result is `FREEMASONRY`.
I don't know if this is intended or not, but its possible that the password was supposed to be `FREEMASONRY` and that the obfuscation system break it.


### `Detected()`

In this subsection, we will try to understand the debugger detection system and why we cannot read the code at start.
This is not necessary to solve the crackme, but it's a way to learn more about .Net process debug detection.

At start, we cannot see the code.
I think that the following part of the crackme is reponsible to load the code of methods dynamically.
An option is to analyze this part, and to try to edit the code.

In our case, we preaferd to work on a dump dnSpy created for.
The function which interest us is the following : `internal static bool Detected()`
If we try to debug the process, the process crash, but we can now see the code of the method.

First of all, we can see that the method return a boolean.
There are 4 `return` in the method, 3 `return result` and 1 `return false`.
We can assume that a `return true` mean that debug is detected.

Looking at code, the following "detection function" seems to be used :
* `IsDebuggerPresent`
* `CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent`
* `get_IsAttached`

For the first two, dnSpy is supposed to be able to handle them :
![image](https://github.com/Cyril-Meyer/RCE/assets/69190238/a0fce11e-a6a5-493c-8853-7e86f1768047)  
For the last, it seems to be a check around `get_IsAttached` which could be `System.Diagnostics.Debugger.get_IsAttached` and looks like `IsDebuggerAttached`.
dnSpy is supposed to handle this too, but It didn't seems to work well.

Anyway, one other way to debug the process, is to run the process normally and to **attach** the debugger after.

In conclusion:
* `Detected()` only block us when we start the process using debugger
* We can probably make some code patching (replace start of method with a `return false`), but we need to see where the code is stored before

I did not go any further in my analysis as the challenge is solved.
