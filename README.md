# RCE
This repository has **educational** purposes and includes videos and reports that I made to **archive** my research in **Reverse Code Engineering**.

If you are a beginner, I advise you to take a look at the **crackme** guides at the bottom of the list, the tables are filled in reverse chronological order.
The most basic explanations have been made on the simplest crackme and are not necessarily repeated.  
By starting this repository, I already have experience in the field, but we still start with fairly easy problems.

List of symbols used:
